            When it comes to running, it is something that has changed my life. When I was in elementry school I was not the most fit kid out there. In fact I was a chubby kid. I wanted
            to change this once we started to train for the fourth and fifth grade mile. When I was in middle school I soon became an avagerage running, an improvement from somebody that 
            was below average. This further improved once I got in High School, I became the varsity runner from long distance track and cross country.

            I have always loved to build and create things. It all started when I was just a young kid, when I became familiar with legos. All I ever asked for as gifts were more legos.
            The next thing that I discovered from my friend was Minecraft. This once again peaked my interest with the ability to create things with an endless supply of blocks. This is 
            around the time that I really started to love technology too, as new technology allowed better gaming experiences.
