        <h2>Green Gro</h2>
        <p>
            Green Gro has given me the ability to learn to be independent. While this job is just a landscaping job, it has given me the responsibiliy to run a crew and to also work self-suffiently.
            This also gave me experiences working with a team to accomplish a task like installing a sprinkler system and hydroseeding. I have truely come to know what hard work is.

        <h2>AIDIA</h2>
        <p>
            AIDIA has given me the most experience in the field of computer science. I have learned how to code in a team and realize just how challenging it can be working in a team. However, I habe
            gained the skills need to work in those teams. I have also gained experience working with AWS and tools like SST, Tailwind, Solid JS, Typescript, and Git.
